NBA Players Command Line Database Application.

The NBA Players APP allows a user to create a username, enter their favorite NBA player, enter a season/year and receive the players respective stats for given year(1981 to present).
A user can add their favorite players to a watchlist, view their watchlist, continue searching for NBA player stats and exit the app.
The App is requesting NBA data from the balldontlie API. https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction
